This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Java: the continuation of program execution after an ArithmeticException.  The code includes a try-catch block that catches the exception.  However, it fails to take appropriate action like logging the error more comprehensively, displaying a user-friendly error message, or terminating the application gracefully. This can lead to unexpected or incorrect results, and it is an uncommon bug because it does not immediately crash the application but instead allows it to continue with potentially corrupted data. The solution file shows improved exception handling.
